Input format:
Input consists of 3 integers and a string
The first input denotes the seating capacity of L1(a)
The second input denotes the seating capacity of L2(b)
The third input denotes the seating capacity of L3(c)
The fourth input denotes the lab which is allocated for ACE training
Output format:
Print the minimal seating capacity lab amongst the available labs.
Refer the Sample output for formatting
